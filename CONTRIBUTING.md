Contributing
------------

Contributing to DTK is easy. Just send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make `master` the destination branch on the
[DTK repository](https://github.com/ORNL-CEES/DataTransferKit).

Your PR must pass DTK's tests. We enforce these guidelines with Jenkins CI.
