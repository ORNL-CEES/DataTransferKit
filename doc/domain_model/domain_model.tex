\begin{abstract}
  The Data Transfer Kit (DTK) is a software component designed to
  provide parallel services for mesh and geometry searching and data
  transfer for arbitrary physics components. In many physics
  applications, the concept of mesh and geometry is used to subdivide
  the physical domain into a discrete representation to facilitate the
  solution of the model problems that describe it. Additionally, the
  concept of the field is used to apply degrees of freedom to the mesh
  or geometry as a means of function discretization. With the
  increased development efforts in multiphysics simulation, adaptive
  mesh simulations, and other multiple mesh/geometry problems,
  generating parallel topology maps for transferring fields and other
  data between meshes is a common operation. This document describes a
  domain model for mesh, geometry, fields, and parallel topology maps
  based on the concept of geometric rendezvous as implemented in DTK.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In many physics applications, it is often desired to transfer fields
(i.e. degrees of freedom or other data) between meshes or geometries
that may or may not conform in physical space. In addition, for
massively parallel simulations, it is typical that geometric domains
not only do not conform spatially, but also that their parallel
decompositions do not correlate and are independent of one another due
to physics-based partitioning and discretization requirements. As an
example, this situation can occur in multiphysics simulations where
physics fields provide feedback between solution iterations or
adaptive mesh simulations where fields must be moved between meshes
after refining and coarsening. It is therefore desirable to have a set
of tools to relate mesh and geometry of arbitrary parallel
decomposition such that fields and other data can be transferred
between them.

The Data Transfer Kit (DTK) is a software component designed to
provide parallel services for mesh and geometry searching and data
transfer based on the concept of the rendezvous decomposition
\cite{Plimpton_2004}. To achieve a component design for use with
arbitrary physics codes, general concepts of mesh, geometry, and
fields are employed to provide access to these services. This document
will outline the concepts of parallel communicators, mesh, geometry,
fields, parallel topology maps, and the rendezvous decomposition and
how they are modeled within the design of DTK. An example of data
transfer using these concepts is also provided.

\subsection{Basic Definitions}\label{subsec:basic_defs}

The following definitions are used throughout this document and serve
as a basis for the domain model and discussion.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Communicator:} An object that allows communication of data
  between and controls the execution of operations on parallel
  processes.
\item {\bf Local Operation:} An operation that occurs within the
  context of a single process. All data and operations on that data
  are performed within the memory space of that process, independent
  of all other processes.
\item {\bf Global Operation:} An operation that occurs within the
  context of the entire parallel domain of the simulation. All data is
  potentially shared via communicator operations.
\item {\bf Ordinal:} A value that uniquely identifies an object from
  other objects of the same type. This number is a positive and real
  integer such that for a given ordinal, $i$, $i \in
  \mathbb{N}_0$.
\item {\bf Geometry:} An object or collection of objects that has $n$
  physical dimensions and a spatial domain $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n$
  that is bounded by a boundary $\Gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
\item {\bf Measure:} The measure of a geometry is defined as length in
  1 dimension, area in 2 dimensions, and volume in 3 dimensions.
\item {\bf Vertex:} A zero-dimensional geometric object that has a
  globally unique ordinal and Cartesian coordinates that describe its
  geometric position. Vertices can have coordinates in 1, 2, or 3
  dimensions.
\item {\bf Node:} A node is zero-dimensional mathematical object that
  describes the support points of a discretized function (e.g. the
  Lagrange basis points of a finite element discretization).
\item {\bf Mesh Element:} A mesh element, $\omega$, is a discrete
  component of the spatial domain $\Omega$ that is constructed by
  vertices. These vertices have a canonical ordering and
  dimensionality that uniquely specifies the element type.
\item {\bf Element Topology:} A specific number of vertices with a
  specific canonical vertex ordering with a specific
  dimensionality. Examples include 4-vertex tetrahedrons and 3-vertex
  triangles. Every mesh element has an element topology.
\item {\bf Mesh:} A discrete representation of the $n$-dimensional
  spatial domain $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of an arbitrary
  number of mesh elements, $\omega$. The mesh elements that construct
  a single mesh {\sl may not intersect}. However, mesh elements may
  intersect if they belong to different meshes. Mesh can be considered
  a subset of geometry.
\item {\bf Mesh Block:} A collection of mesh elements that exist in
  the same mesh and have the same element topology.  A mesh is
  composed of one or more mesh blocks.
\item {\bf Degrees of Freedom:} Discrete values generated by a physics
  computation that describe the discretization of a quantity over
  phase space.
\item {\bf Field:} A discrete representaion of a $D$-dimensional
  function, $F$, over the domain $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that
  $F(r) : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D, \forall r \in
  \Omega$. A field spans a domain and the discretization of that
  domain (e.g. a domain is resolved by mesh elements and therefore the
  field spans the mesh and its elements).
\item {\bf Evaluator:} An object that evaluates a field at a physical
  location, $\hat{r}$, in the spatial domain $\Omega$ by computing
  $F(\hat{r})$. This operation is valid $\forall \hat{r} \in \Omega$.
\item {\bf Source:} A geometry that owns a spatial domain, $\Omega_S
  \in \mathbb{R}^n$, over which an evaluator can be applied for a
  given field $F(s)$ where $s \in \Omega_s$.
\item {\bf Data Space:} A field, $G$, of dimension $D$, to which data
  can be applied such that $G(r) : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^D, r \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
\item {\bf Target:} A geometry that owns a spatial domain, $\Omega_T
  \in \mathbb{R}^n$, over which a data space, $G(t)$ can be defined
  where $t \in \Omega_T$.
\item{\bf Geometric Rendezvous:} A geometric-based parallel
  redistribution of the original source and target geometries defined
  over the region $\Omega_R = \Omega_S \cap \Omega_T$.
\item{\bf Parallel Topology Map:} An operator, $M$, that defines the
  translation of a field, $F(s)$, from a source spatial domain,
  $\Omega_S$, to a field, $G(t$), in the target spatial domain
  $\Omega_T$, such that $G(t)\leftarrow M(F(s))$ and $M: \mathbb{R}^D
  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D, \forall r \in \Omega_R$, where $\Omega_R$
  is the geometric rendezvous of the source and target.
\end{itemize}

\section{Communicators}\label{sec:communicators}
A communicator is a concept that encapsulates ownership of operations
in a parallel computation. A parallel communicator in the context of
DTK can be taken as a direct reference to a Message Passing Interface
(MPI) communicator \cite{MPI_1994}. A single communicator has a set of
process space over which it may perform operations. Multiple
communicators may exist in a single process space and own the same
processes. For objects decomposed in parallel, the term global will be
used to refer to concepts that apply across the entire parallel domain
owned by a communicator while the term local will be used to refer to
concepts that only exist in the domain of a single parallel process. A
communicator is not required to encompass all of global process
space. Based on this, we can consider union and intersection
operations. Two communicators will be deemed equivalent if they own
the same set of processes.

\subsection{Communicator Union}\label{subsec:comm_union}
A union operation will compute the union in process space of all
communicators involved. This will be a common operation for cases
where one particular geometric component in the data transfer
operation is decomposed over a different communicator than another
geometric component. Figure~\ref{fig:comm_union} provides an example
of a union operation. In this example, two communicators, A and B, are
defined within the domain of a global communicator (typically, but not
necessarily MPI\_COMM\_WORLD) but do not encapsulate all of it. All
processes that exist either in communicator A or B will be used to
form the new union communicator ($C_{union}$) as a subset of the
global communicator ($C_{global}$) such that $C_{union} = A \cup B$
and $C_{union} \in C_{global}$. This operation is only valid if $A \in
C_{global}$ and $B \in C_{global}$.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{union_comm.pdf}
  \caption{\bf \sl Communicator union operation diagram.}{\sl In this
    example, communicator A and communicator B are contained within
    the global communicator but do not encapsulate all of it. Their
    combined communication spaces form the union. The union is a
    subset of the global communicator.}
  \label{fig:comm_union}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Communicator Intersection}\label{subsec:comm_intersection}
An intersection operation will compute the intersection in process
space of all communicators
involved. Figure~\ref{fig:comm_intersection} provides an example of an
intersection operation. In this example, two communicators, A and B,
are defined within a global communicator but do not encapsulate all of
it. All processes that exist in both communicator A and B will be used
to form the intersection communicator. The intersection communicator
($C_{intersect}$) is a subset of the global communicator
($C_{global}$) such that $C_{intersect} = A \cap B$ and $C_{intersect}
\in C_{global}$. This operation is only valid if $A \in C_{global}$
and $B \in C_{global}$.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{intersection_comm.pdf}
  \caption{\bf \sl Communicator intersection operation diagram.}{\sl
    In this example, communicator A and communicator B are contained
    within the global communicator but do not encapsulate all of
    it. The blue communication space forms the intersection.}
  \label{fig:comm_intersection}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\section{Mesh}\label{sec:mesh}
In order to access DTK mesh services, a subset of the information
needed to describe the mesh is required. This subset consists of
vertices and their coordinates, elements and the vertices that
construct them, and the communicator over which they are defined. The
vertices that construct an element have both a canonical ordering
consistent across all elements of that topology in a mesh and a
permutation list that describes how this ordering varies from DTK
canonical ordering. This subset has been demonstrated as sufficient
for applying data transfer algorithms \cite{Stewart_2004} and can be
formulated in such a way that algorithms can be generated that are
data structure neutral \cite{Chand_2008}. In addition, for meshes that
contain multiple element topologies, the concept of mesh blocked by
element topology is utilized.

\subsection{Mesh Vertices}\label{subsec:vertices}
Vertices are the lowest level geometric component of the mesh. All
vertices have a globally unique ordinal serving as an identification
number for the vertex in global operations. A vertex can have 1, 2, or
3 dimensions but all vertices in a mesh must have the same
dimension. To specify its geometric position, each vertex has
Cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates. A vertex must provide only the
coordinates for the specified vertex dimension, no more or no less
(e.g. a 2 dimensional vertex must provide x and y coordinates but not
a z coordinate). A vertex may be repeated any number of times across
the parallel domain with unlimited local and global
instances. However, every vertex with the same globally unique ordinal
must have the same coordinates. We make a distinction here between
vertices and nodes. In the context of DTK, a vertex is purely a
geometric object. It describes the spatial positioning and geometric
bounds of an element. A node is purely a mathematical object. It
descrbibes the descretization associated with a particular element
described within the natural coordinate system of that element. It is
possible that in the physical coordinate frame that a node and vertex
may occupy the same geometric location, however DTK does not consider
nodes in its formulation.

As an example, consider Figure~\ref{fig:mesh_vertices} depicting a
series of vertices contained in a mesh. Each vertex provides a
globally unique ordinal and set of 3 dimensional coordinates.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{hex_nodes.pdf}
  \caption{\bf \sl Basic vertex description for a mesh.}{\sl Each
    vertex is required to have a unique global ordinal, a specified
    dimensionality, and Cartesian coordinates corresponding to that
    dimensonality. The vertices in this example are 3 dimensional.}
  \label{fig:mesh_vertices}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mesh Elements}\label{subsec:elements}
Elements are the second level of abstraction in the mesh description
above vertices. All elements have a globally unique ordinal serving as
an identification number for the element in global operations. This
globally unique ordinal can be the same as a globally unique ordinal
for a vertex in the mesh as DTK distinguishes between vertices and
elements. An element has a topology defining its physical structure
(e.g. tetrahedron, hexahedron, etc.) and a number of vertices needed
to generate that topology. Elements are constructed from vertices via
a connectivity list. The connectivity list for a particular element
will contain the unique vertex global ordinals that construct its
linear form. An element may be repeated any number of times across the
parallel domain (i.e. it may have unlimited local instances), however,
every globally unique ordinal must have the same connectivity list
associated with it. For consistency, DTK uses the MoaB Canonical
Numbering (MBCN) scheme as a canonical ordering scheme
\cite{Tautges_2009}. Each element in a client mesh can be described
with a connectivity list using any canonical scheme of choice,
however, the relationship between this canonical numbering scheme and
the DTK canonical numbering scheme must be made available. Each
element topology is therefore also described by a permutation list. A
permutation list specifies the variation in ordering between the DTK
canonical numbering scheme and the client canonical numbering
scheme. A permutation list must be described globally, regardless of
whether or not elements exist on a particular process. See
Appendix~\ref{apdx:cell_topo} for canonical element topologies as
defined by DTK. These are the canonical vertex orderings that must be
used when generating a permutation list for a client element
topology. Mesh elements may not intersect any other elements in a
single mesh description. An element may intersect other elements if
those elements exist in another mesh (this is in fact a common
situation in data transfer).

Consider the continuation of our example in
Figure~\ref{fig:mesh_element} showing a linear hexahedron element
generated from the vertices in Figure~\ref{fig:mesh_vertices}. The
element has been given a unique global ordinal and the connectivity
and permutation lists have been specified. The connectivity list
specifies an element construction from counter-clockwise movement
around the bottom face and then counter-clockwise movement around the
top face that is native to the client. The MBCN canonical ordering for
linear hexahedrons is given at the vertices. Note that MBCN ordering
instead uses clockwise rotation around the bottom and top faces to
construct the element. This difference in ordering is specified by the
given permutation list.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{hex_element.pdf}
  \caption{\bf \sl Basic element description for a mesh.}{\sl Each
    element is required to have a unique global ordinal, and a
    specified connectivity and permutation list. The MBCN canonical
    vertex ordinals used by DTK, the client canonical vertex ordinals,
    and the client global vertex ordinals are specified at the
    vertices.}
  \label{fig:mesh_element}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mesh Blocks}\label{subsec:blocks}
At the highest level of abstraction, the mesh is composed of mesh
blocks. All elements in a block must have the same topology and number
of vertices. A mesh may contain as many blocks as desired. Multiple
blocks with the same mesh topology may exist. Vertices may be repeated
in different mesh blocks provided that they maintain the same unique
global ordinal and coordinates. Elements may be repeated in different
mesh blocks provided that they maintain the same unique global ordinal
and connectivity list. All elements and vertices in all blocks of the
mesh must have the same dimension. Multiple mesh blocks may exist in
the same spatial region as they are merely a means of subdividing the
mesh into groups of elements based on their topology. This behavior
will be the common when hybrid meshes are involved (e.g. a mesh that
contains hexahedrons and tetrahedrons). Mesh blocks may be either
structured or unstructured.

As an example, consider the 2 dimensional hybrid mesh presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_mesh}. This mesh contains both quadrilateral
(blue) and triangle (red) elements that share connecting vertices. In
this case, all quadrilaterals should be specified in a single mesh
block and all triangles specified in another mesh block. The vertices
shared by these two mesh blocks may be repeated in either block.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{hybrid_mesh.pdf}
  \caption{\bf \sl Hybrid mesh example.} {\sl Quadrilaterals (blue)
    must be specified in a different mesh block than the triangles
    (red). Both blocks can contain the mutual mesh vertices that
    construct their elements.}
  \label{fig:hybrid_mesh}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parallel Decomposition}\label{subsec:mesh_decomp}
Mesh blocks and the elements and vertices they contain may be
partitioned in any fashion provided that all vertices, elements, and
blocks of a mesh description exist in a communication space operated
on by the same parallel communicator. Different blocks in a single
mesh description may not have different communicators. Each mesh
description may have its own communicator. Global knowledge of the
parallel decomposition of a given mesh description is not
required. Only local mesh data access along with the proper
communicator is required.

\section{Geometry}\label{sec:geometry}
A geometry is simply an object or collection of objects that has $n$
physical dimensions and a spatial domain $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n$
that is bounded by a boundary $\Gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Concrete
examples of geometries in 3 dimensions include cubes and cylinders. A
geometry can have 1, 2, or three dimensions. All geometry objects have
a globally unique ordinal serving as an identification number for the
geometry in global operations. To specify the general position in
space of the geometry, each object is required to have a centroid
given in Cartesian coordinates with (x) given for 1 dimensional
geometries, (x,y) for two dimensions, and (x,y,z) for 3 dimensions. A
measure is also specified for each geometry where the measure is
defined as length in 1 dimension, area in 2 dimensions, and volume in
3 dimensions. In addition to this data, a geometry must be able to
provide a Cartesian axis-aligned bounding box that encapsulates the
entire geometry. For geometric search operations to be performed, a
geometry must be able to determine if a given point of the same
dimensionality as the geometry is contained within the boundary of the
geometry (i.e. $\hat{r} \in \Omega$).

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\section{Fields}\label{sec:field}
In the most general sense, a field refers to the degrees of freedom
computed by a physics code or the responses derived from those degrees
of freedom that have been discretized across the domain
\cite{LIME_2011}. The field is implicitly bound to the geometric
domain through the degrees of freedom and their association with a
mesh or other geometric components. In a physics simulation, examples
of degrees of freedom include pressure and velocity distributions and
examples of computed reponses include heat flux or reaction rates. In
order to access DTK field services, a subset of information needed to
describe the field is required. A field has a dimension of arbitrary
size. As examples, for scalar fields this dimension is 1, for
3-vectors (such as the velocity example above in a 3 dimensional
computation) the dimension is 3, and for a $3 \times 3$ tensor the
dimension is 9.  All local instances of the field must have the same
dimension. A field can have an arbitrary number of local degrees of
freedom and this size can differ from local domain to local domain. No
knowledge of the global field decomposition is required, however, it
must exist on a single communicator.

\subsection{Field Evaluations}\label{subsec:field_eval}
The actual discretization of the field is not explicitly
formulated. Rather, access to discretization of fields and the
associated data is generated through function evaluations at points in
physical space. Consider a $D$-dimensional function $F(r)$ of
arbitrary discretization over the spatial domain $\Omega \in
\mathbb{R}^n$ where $r \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $F : \mathbb{R}^n
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D$. Via polynomial interpolation, projection,
or any other means necessary to most appropriately reflect the
discretization of $F(r)$, it then follows that evaluation operations
of the following type can be performed:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{f} \leftarrow F(\hat{r}), \forall \hat{r} \in \Omega
  \label{eq:evaluation}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{r} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a single point and $\hat{f} \in
\mathbb{R}^D$ is representative of the function $F(r)$ evaluated at
$\hat{r}$. This operation is not valid for $\hat{r} \notin \Omega$. In
the context of $\Omega$ discretized by a mesh, these evaluations can
instead be written in terms of a single mesh element, $\omega \in
\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{f} \leftarrow F(\hat{r}), \forall \hat{r} \in \omega
  \label{eq:element_evaluation}
\end{equation}
This operation is then not valid for $\hat{r} \notin \omega$. If
$\hat{r} \notin \omega$ and $\hat{r} \notin \Omega$, then alternative
schemes may be chosen, such as extrapolation, in order to apply the
field to $\hat{r}$. An evaluator is an object that drives the
application of Eq~(\ref{eq:element_evaluation}).

\subsection{Field Integrations}\label{subsec:field_integrations}
As a complement to field evaluations at points, fields may also be
integrated over a region of space, $\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
  f_{\Omega} = \int_{\Omega} F(r) dr\:,
  \label{eq:integration}
\end{equation}
where $f_{\Omega}$ is now representative of the integral of the field
$F(r)$ over the domain $\Omega$. In the context of $\Omega$
discretized by a mesh, these integrals can instead be written in terms
of a single mesh element, $\omega \in \Omega$:
\begin{equation}
  f_{\omega} = \int_{\omega} F(r) dr\:,
  \label{eq:element_integration}
\end{equation}
where the integral over $\Omega$ will be the measure-weighted
summation of all element integrals:
\begin{equation}
  f_{\Omega} = \frac{1}{m_{\Omega}} \sum_i f_{{\omega}_i},\ \forall
  \omega_i \in \Omega\:,
  \label{eq:integral_sum}
\end{equation}
where $m_{\Omega}$ is the measure of the geometric domain.

\subsection{The Relationship Between Mesh and Fields}
\label{subsec:mesh_and_fields}
The relationship between the mesh and the field in DTK is
implicitly defined. As stated in Eq~(\ref{eq:evaluation}), a field
evaluation is only valid over a particular spatial domain $\Omega$. We
define the mesh over that same domain $\Omega$. In addition, as stated
in Eq~(\ref{eq:element_evaluation}), the discrete element components
of the mesh, $\omega$, also have a relationship with the field. Given
a particular element in the mesh such that $\omega \in \Omega$, the
field is then also bound to those discrete components. The discrete
form of the field then forms an aggregate with the discrete form of
the mesh. The responses derived from that field also are also bound to
the mesh through this relationship.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\section{Geometric Rendezvous}\label{sec:rendezvous}
Relating two non-conformal meshes will ultimately require some type of
evaluation algorithm to apply the data from one geometry to another as
specified by Eq.~(\ref{eq:evaluation}). To drive these evaluation
algorithms, the target objects to which this data will be applied must
be located within the the source geometry. In a serial formulation,
efficient search structures that offer logarithmic asymptotic time
complexity are available to perform this operation. However, in a
parallel formulation, if these two geometries are arbitrarily
decomposed, geometric alignment is not likely and a certain degree of
communication will be required. A geometric rendezvous manipulates the
source and target geometries such that all geometric operations have a
local formulation.

A geometry that is associated with the providing data through function
evaluations will be referred to as the source geometry while the
geometry that will be receiving the data will be referred to as the
target geometry. Although explicitly formulated with a source mesh and
target vertices below, these concepts can be applied to geometric
structures beyond mesh and vertices.

\subsection{The Rendezvous Algorithm}\label{subsec:rendezvous_alg}
The geometric rendezvous concept uses a global formulation for the
data transfer while maintaining a local formulation for the geometric
search operations. In DTK, the following algorithm developed by
Plimpton et. al. \cite{Plimpton_2004} generates the rendezvous
decomposition through global operations in order to achieve a local
framework for geometric operations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute a box that bounds the source and target geometry
  intersection.
\item Create a rendezvous decomposition by performing recursive
  coordinate bisectioning on the source geometry.
\item Send source geometry from the source decomposition to rendezvous
  decomposition.
\item Clone source geometry components which overlap into nearby
  recursive coordinate bisectioning sub-domains.
\item Build a kD-tree with the local mesh in each rendezvous
  partition.
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm is elaborated in more detail in the following
paragraphs.

\paragraph{Step 1: Bounding box construction.}
To begin, a global bounding box for the source and target geometries
is constructed using their nodal data. These two bounding boxes are
then intersected to produce the bounding box around the intersection
of the two geometries. Those source or target vertices that are not
inside this intersection bounding box are not considered for the
remainder of the algorithm. This step is motivated by the fact that
for many classes of data transfer problems, such as 2 dimensional
surface transfer in a full 3 dimensional problem, only a small subset
of the source and target geometries will be used. This will reduce the
number of search operations and communication operations.

\paragraph{Step 2: Rendezvous decomposition generation.}
Recursive coordinate bisectioning (RCB) is used the create a new
decomposition with the source mesh vertices \cite{Berger_1987}. We
choose RCB here to repartition the source mesh to achieve a more
load-balanced decomposition for geometric operations. For many physics
codes, the parallel decomposition of the mesh is generated with
physics-related efficiencies in mind. For the purposes of geometric
operations related to search mesh data structures, the geometric
nature of RCB alleviates the potential inefficiencies for geometric
operations that may be incurred by using the original source
decomposition. This new decomposition, the rendezvous decomposition,
will serve as an intermediary between the original source and target
decompositions.

\paragraph{Step 3: Send source elements to rendezvous decomposition.}
The RCB decomposition is generated only from source mesh vertex
information. The element information must be sent to the rendezvous
decomposition and reconstructed for the point location process.

\paragraph{Step 4: Clone source elements that overlap RCB
  sub-domains.}  Because RCB was performed using source nodal data,
there will be source elements that span the boundary between two or
more RCB sub-domains. When this occurs, the source elements will be
repeated in each RCB sub-domain in which their connectivity vertices
exist.

\paragraph{Step 5: Build a kD-tree with the local mesh in each rendezvous
  partition.}  On each rendezvous process, the local mesh is searched
with the local target vertices. A kD-tree is generated using the local
mesh for a fast proximity search of the domain that computes a small
subset of the local mesh that resides near the vertex
\cite{Bentley_1975}.

\subsection{The Rendezvous Decomposition}\label{subsec:rendezvous_decomp}
Using the above algorithm, a secondary decomposition of a subset of
the source mesh is generated forming the rendezvous decomposition. The
rendezvous decomposition is encapsulated as a separate entity from the
original geometric description of the domain. It can be viewed as a
copy of the source mesh subset that intersects the target
geometry. This copy has been repartitioned in a way that fundamental
geometric search operations are local and proceed globally in a load
balanced fashion.

The rendezvous decomposition has several properties. It is defined
over a communicator that encapsulates the union of the communication
spaces owned by the source and target geometries. It is defined inside
of a global, axis-aligned bounding box that bounds the intersection of
the source and target geometries. The decomposition is of the same
dimension as the source and target geometries. A rendezvous
decomposition cannot be generated with source and target geometries of
different dimensions (e.g. a 3 dimensional source geometry and a 2
dimensional target geometry cannot be used to generate a rendezvous
decomposition).

\subsection{Searching the Rendezvous Decomposition}
\label{subsec:rendezvous_search}
By implementing the above algorithm, we effectively have a search
structure that spans both parallel and physical space. We first search
parallel space by querying the rendezvous decomposition generated
during repartitioning. Global recursive coordinate bisectioning
parameters are maintained for global partitioning information, meaning
that a desintation process in the rendezvous decomposition can be
determined for any point on any process. Although this is a search
over parallel space, because of the geometric nature of the rendezvous
decomposition it is also a search over physical space with each
process in the rendezvous decomposition owning a specific subset of
the mesh (with marginal overlap at the boundaries).

Once points have been accumulated in the rendezvous decomposition, the
local kD-tree that is formed over the local mesh can be utilized. By
searching the kD-tree in logarithmic time, a subset of the mesh that
is in the vicinity of the target point is generated. This subset,
which is typically much smaller than the mesh owned by a particular
rendezvous procees, is then searched with a more expensive
point-in-element operation that transforms the vertex into the
reference frame of each element in the subset with a Newton iteration
strategy. This mapped point is then checked against the canonical
reference cell of that element's topology to determine if the vertex
is contained within.

\section{Parallel Topology Maps}\label{sec:map}
A parallel topology map is an operator, $M$, that defines the
translation of a field, $F(s)$, from a source spatial domain,
$\Omega_S$, to a field, $G(t)$, in the target spatial domain
$\Omega_T$, such that $M: \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D,
\forall r \in [\Omega_S \cap \Omega_T]$, using both geometric and
parallel operations. There are 3 types of physics-based parallel
topology maps: shared domain maps, interface maps, and network maps
\cite{LIME_2011}.  Currently, DTK only supports shared domain maps.

\subsection{Shared Domain Problems}\label{subsec:shared_domain}
A shared domain problem is one in which the geometric domains of the
source and target intersect over all dimensions of the
problem. Figure~\ref{fig:shared_domain} gives an example of a shared
domain problem in 3 dimensions. Here, $\Omega(S)$ ({\sl yellow}) is
the source geometry, $\Omega(T)$ ({\sl blue}) is the target geometry,
and $\Omega(R)$ ({\sl red}) is their intersection and the shared
domain over which mapping and the rendezvous decomposition will be
generated.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{overlapping_domain.pdf}
  \caption{\bf \sl Shared domain example.} {\sl $\Omega(S)$ (yellow)
    is the source geometry, $\Omega(T)$ (blue) is the target geometry,
    and $\Omega(R)$ (red) is the shared domain.}
  \label{fig:shared_domain}
\end{figure}

The shared domain map has several properties. It is defined over a
communicator that encapsulates the union of the communication spaces
owned by the source and target geometries.  The map is of the same
dimension as the source and target geometries. A shared domain map
cannot be generated with source and target geometries of different
dimensions (e.g. a 3 dimensional source geometry and a 2 dimensional
target geometry cannot be used to generate a shared domain map). The
source and target domains may have an arbitrary parallel decomposition
unrelated to one another. There are 3 types of shared domain mapping
algorithms implemented in DTK: the traditional mesh-based rendezvous
algorithm, the geometry source map, and the integral assembly map.

\subsubsection{Mesh-Based Shared Domain Mapping Algorithm}
\label{subsubsec:shared_domain_alg}
The following mapping algorithm is applied using the rendezvous
decomposition to build a parallel topology map for shared domain
problems where both the source and target geometries are represented
by mesh.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine which target geometry components to operate on by
  finding those that reside in the rendezvous decomposition global
  bounding box.
\item Find which rendezvous sub-domain each target geometry component
  is inside of and determine the process which owns this sub-domain.
\item Send target geometry from target decomposition to rendezvous
  decomposition.
\item Find which target geometry component is inside which source
  geometry component.
\item Send source/target pairings from rendezvous decomposition to
  source decomposition.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Step 1: Get the target vertices that are in the rendezvous
  decomposition bounding box.}  We will only operate on those vertices
that are contained within the rendezvous decomposition bounding
box. Those that are not will not participate in mapping.

\paragraph{Step 2: Find rendezvous subdomain for target vertices.}
On each target process, the RCB decomposition is searched to find the
destination process for the target vertex in the rendezvous
decomposition.

\paragraph{Step 3: Send target vertices to rendezvous decomposition.}
Each target vertex is moved to the appropriate RCB sub-domain for the
point location step.

\paragraph{Step 4: Find the source elements in which target vertices reside.}
We now have source element information and target vertex information
in the rendezvous decomposition. On each rendezvous process, the local
mesh is searched with the local target vertices using the kD-tree and
underlying point-in-element functionality.

\paragraph{Step 5: Send element/vertex pairs back to original
  decompositions.}  The source element/target vertex pairs are the map
in this case and they will be used to drive the function evaluation
routines. These pairings must be communicated from the rendezvous
decomposition back to the source/target decompositions to complete the
mapping.

\subsubsection{Geometry Source Map}
\label{subsubsec:geometry_source_map}
A slight variation of the mesh-based rendezvous algorithm is one in
which the source field is defined over a set of geometric structures
instead of a mesh. There are two potential use cases for this type of
map: one in which the target is a set of points at which the source
function should be evaluated and another in which the target is a
group of geometric objects identical to those in the source but with a
possibly different parallel distribution. For the first case, the
general point location algorithm is the same as above but instead an
array of general geometric structures is searched. Those geometries
may span the domain of more than one parallel process, but if they do
then their entire description is required on each process. The result
of the mapping sequence is a set of geometry/target point pairs used
to drive the evaluation algorithms for the source functions within the
geometries.

For the second use case, a few assumptions about the source and target
geometries are used to enable geometry-to-geometry mappings where the
parallel decompositions of the geometries are not known a priori. The
first assumption requires both the source and target geometries to
occupy the same physical space (i.e. a cylinder in the source code has
the same height, radius, and centroid as the cylinder in the target
code). If this assumption is valid, it then follows that if the
centroids of the target geometries are supplied as the target points
for this map, then the source geometries in which they are located
correlate to their identical counterparts in target geometries. In
this context, the field evaluations are then interpreted as simply
gathering the geometry-related quanities (which still may involve a
function evaluation or integration) and redistributing them to the
target decomposition.

\subsubsection{Integral Assembly Map}
\label{subsubsec:integral_assembly_map}
In certain cases of data transfer, a target physics code may desire
quanities averaged over the spatial domain to be applied to its
geometry. If the source code uses the same geometric representation,
then the geometry source map may be used as described above. However,
if the source code uses a mesh-based discretization of the spatial
domain, then this averaged quantity will require the following measure
weighted integral to be performed over the source field defined on the
mesh elements and appropriately assembled in parallel over the proper
geometric structures:
\begin{equation}
  f_{\Omega} = \frac{\int_{\Omega} F(r) dr}{\int_{\Omega} dr}\:,
  \label{eq:measure_weighted_int}
\end{equation}
which if interpeted as an integral of a field defined over a mesh
gives:
\begin{equation}
  f_{\Omega} = \frac{\sum_i \Big[ \int_{{\omega}_i} F(r)
      dr \Big]}{m_{\Omega}}\:,
  \label{eq:element_weighted_int}
\end{equation}
where $m_{\Omega}$ is the measure of the target geometry and the
integrations are as outlined in \S~\ref{subsec:field_integrations}. If
the mesh is assumed conformal to the geometry then:
\begin{equation}
  m_{\Omega} = \sum_i m_{{\omega}_i},\ \forall \omega_i \in \Omega\:,
  \label{eq:measure_equality}
\end{equation}
where $m_{{\omega}_i}$ is the measure of the $i^{th}$ mesh element
that is physically within the geometry.

As the source mesh elements and target geometries may have an
arbitrary parallel decomposition, the rendezvous decomposition is used
to correlate the two. In this mapping algorithm, the rendezvous
decomposition is used to determine which mesh elements are contained
within each geometric entity. As it is assumed that the mesh is
conformal to the geometry, the vertices of the mesh elements are
checked for point inclusion with the geometry where either a single
vertex or all vertices may be required for element inclusion. Once
this parallel mapping information is acquired, the measures of the
target geometries are approximated by gathering the measures of the
individual elements that compute their sums. To drive the application
of the map, we use a mesh-element integration function for each field
in the source code to acquire $m_{{\omega}_i} \int_{{\omega}_i} F(r)
dr$ in the source decomposition. These measure-weighted element
integrals are then moved into the target decomposition and the sum in
Eq~(\ref{eq:element_weighted_int}) is computed for each target
geometry using the computed geometry measures.

\subsubsection{Handling Target Objects Outside of the Source Domain}
\label{subsubsec:shared_domain_missed_points}
The mesh-based shared domain map and the geometry source map both have
several steps in which target objects may or may not be found in the
source mesh. Both the RCB decomposition search and kD-tree search have
the potential to return target objects that were not found in the
source mesh. The source function will not be evaluated at these points
as they are not in the domain $\Omega_S$, and therefore the evaluation
operation will not be valid. However, a list of these points in the
target decomposition may be generated for further processing by the
client.

\section{An Example}
Consider the following 2-dimensional shared domain problem that
utilizes the above concepts and the mesh-based rendezvous algorithm to
map a field from one mesh to another. Note that the data presented in
this example was generated externally from DTK for the purpose of
visualizing the algorithm.

A linear triangle mesh is chosen for the source mesh as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:source_mesh}. The source mesh is decomposed over 4
parallel processes with each process operating on elements of a single
color. The target mesh is defined with linear quadrilaterals and is
given by Figure~\ref{fig:target_mesh}. Here, the decomposition is also
over 4 processes but with a different spatial decomposition. We
therefore expect communication between all 4 processes in this
example.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{tri_part.png}
  \caption{\bf \sl Source mesh for 2D shared domain example.}{\sl Each
    color represents the portion of the mesh owned by each parallel
    process.}
  \label{fig:source_mesh}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{quad_part.png}
  \caption{\bf \sl Target mesh for 2D shared domain example.}{\sl Each
    color represents the portion of the mesh owned by each parallel
    process.}
  \label{fig:target_mesh}
\end{figure}

Using the rendezvous algorithm, we repartition the source and target
geometries such that they align in a new, geometric-based partitioning
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rendezvous_part}. In parallel search
operations, we then first search the partition domains to get the
rendezvous process containing a particular target object. We then
communicate this point to the proper process in
Figure~\ref{fig:rendezvous_part} and search that process' domain using
the kD-tree. The source element/target object pairs generated from
this search process are then communicated back to the process that
owns the source in element in the decomposition given by
Figure~\ref{fig:source_mesh}.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{tri_rend.png}
  \caption{\bf \sl Rendezvous decomposition for 2D shared domain
    example.}{\sl Each color represents the portion of the mesh owned
    by each parallel process. Both the source and target geometries
    are repartitioned in this fashion such that all search operations
    are on-process.}
  \label{fig:rendezvous_part}
\end{figure}

Shown in Figure~\ref{fig:source_field}, we define a field over the
source mesh, in this case the peaks function, to transfer to the
target mesh. This function is valid only over the domain of the mesh
and can be evaluated at any 2-dimensional point that resides in a
valid element.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{tri_peaks.png}
  \caption{\bf \sl Source function for 2D shared domain example.}{\sl
    A 2D peaks function is defined over the source domain.}
  \label{fig:source_field}
\end{figure}

Finally, an evaluator associated with the source mesh is used to drive
peaks function evaluations on the target mesh vertices in the source
decomposition given by Figure~\ref{fig:source_mesh}. These are then
communicated back to the target decomposition, resulting in the field
transferred as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:target_field}.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{quad_peaks.png}
  \caption{\bf \sl Target function for 2D shared domain example.}{\sl
    A 2D peaks function is transferred to the target domain.}
