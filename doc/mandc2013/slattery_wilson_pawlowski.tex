\section*{ABSTRACT} 
\begin{quote}
\begin{small}
The Data Transfer Kit (DTK) is a software component designed to
provide parallel services for mesh searching and data transfer for
arbitrary physics components based on the concept of geometric
rendezvous. The rendezvous algorithm provides a means to geometrically
correlate two meshes that may be arbitrarily decomposed in a parallel
simulation. By repartitioning both meshes such that they have the same
geometric domain on each parallel process, efficient and load balanced
search operations and field evaluations can be performed at a
desirable algorithmic time complexity with low communication overhead
relative to other types of mapping algorithms. With the increased
development efforts in multiphysics simulation, adaptive mesh
simulations, and other multiple mesh problems, generating parallel
topology maps for transferring fields and other data between meshes is
a common operation. This document describes a domain model for mesh,
fields, and parallel topology maps based on the concept of geometric
rendezvous as implemented in DTK and gives the results of initial
scaling studies performed on the Jaguar system at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory.


\emph{Key Words}: data transfer, multiphysics, rendezvous, parallel

\Section{INTRODUCTION} 

Paper starts here with two blank lines before first section title.  Use 
8.5 x 11 paper size, with 1" margins on all sides.  Double-space before and
after each subsequent section's title.  Most of the formatting is globally
set by the specifications given in the {\it mc2013.cls} file.  
First-level section titles must be all uppercase and centered, and must 
be numbered in Arabic numerals as shown above.  Unlike the Word and WordPerfect
templates, the body text and section titles for this {\LaTeX} template use 
11-point font.  A. Sood found that the 11-point font in {\LaTeX} more closely 
matched the 12-point font in Word and WordPerfect.  Introduce the topic of 
your work in this section.

The first line of a paragraph is not indented; rather double-space between 
paragraphs.  This is done automatically. If you are a {\LaTeX} expert you 
can likely define the established format characteristics in a more elegant 
manner than what is done here.  This is perfectly fine, so long as the 
established paper format/appearance is maintained.  This template is merely 
to assist with maintaining uniformity in paper appearance.

There are four types of reference styles: journal paper\cite{journal}, 
proceedings paper\cite{proc_paper}, book\cite{book}, and website\cite{website}.
References to websites are discouraged, but acceptable if absolutely necessary.
The paper will be included as a {\it .pdf} file for the proceedings. Note that 
it is the author's responsibility to review the final PDF version of the paper
to ensure proper translation into PDF.  Final PDF file size should be no more 
than 10 MB. Recommended paper length is 10-12 pages.

\Section{SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT MAJOR HEADING} 
\label{sec:first}

This is Section~\ref{sec:first}. It is followed by a subsection, that is, 
\ref{sec:second}. For this class file you must use the 
\texttt{$\backslash$Section\{\}} to denote sections (note the capital ``S'').  
The style for subsection titles and all text in this template is defined in 
the {\it mc2013.cls} file.  Make sure to avoid widow/orphan lines.


\Subsection{Subsection Title: First Character of Each Non-trivial Word is 
Uppercase} 
\label{sec:second}

Double-space before and after secondary titles is automatic.  Figures and 
tables should appear as close as possible to where they are first
cited, e.g., Fig. \ref{fig:amdahl}, in the text.  Figures are numbered in 
Arabic numerals, with the caption centered below the figure, in 
{\bf boldface}.
  
Triple-space before the figure, and after the figure caption.

\end{figure}

When importing figures or any graphical image please verify two things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Any number, text or symbol is in Times font and is not smaller than 
    10-point after reduction to the actual window in your paper
\item That is can be translated into PDF
\end{itemize}


Equations, such as Eq. (\ref{sample_equation}), should be centered and 
sequentially numbered to the flush right of the formula.
\begin{equation}
\label{sample_equation}
Speedup\ =\ {1 \over{{f \over {p}} + (1-f)}}
\end{equation}
The continuation of a paragraph after an equation should not be indented.  
All paragraphs, as well as section or subsection headings, are separated by 
just one single empty line.


\Subsubsection{Sub-section level and lower: only first character uppercase}

See Table \ref{table:example} for a sample table.  The tabls package is
recommended for improved row and column spacing.  Notice the caption appears 
above the table by setting the \texttt{$\backslash$caption} command immediately 
after the \texttt{$\backslash$begin\{table\}}. Tables are numbered in Roman 
numerals, with the caption centered above the table, in {\bf boldface}.  
Triple-space before and after the table.
