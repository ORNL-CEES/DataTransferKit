 \class MeshManager
 \brief Manager object for mesh.

 The MeshManager manages the topology blocks that construct a mesh and its
 parallel decomposition. The mesh manager also keeps track of the mesh
 vertices and elements that are active in partitioning and searching. Those
 that are not active are typically outside some domain of interest.

 All elements in a block must have the same topology and number of vertices. A
 mesh may contain as many blocks as desired. Multiple blocks with the same
 mesh topology may exist. Vertices may be repeated in different mesh blocks
 provided that they maintain the same unique global ordinal and
 coordinates. Elements may be repeated in different mesh blocks provided that
 they maintain the same unique global ordinal and connectivity list. All
 elements and vertices in all blocks of the mesh must have the same
 dimension. Multiple mesh blocks may exist in the same spatial region as they
 are merely a means of subdividing the mesh into groups of elements based on
 their topology. This behavior will be the common when hybrid meshes are
 involved (e.g. a mesh that contains hexahedrons and tetrahedrons). Mesh
 blocks may be either structured or unstructured.

 Mesh blocks and the elements and vertices they contain may be partitioned in
 any fashion provided that all vertices, elements, and blocks of a mesh
 description exist in a communication space operated on by the same parallel
 communicator. Different blocks in a single mesh description may not have
 different communicators. Each mesh description may have its own
 communicator. Global knowledge of the parallel decomposition of a given mesh
 description is not required. Only local mesh data access along with the
 proper communicator is required.
