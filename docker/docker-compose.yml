    # Turn off seccomp confinement to work with gdb.

    # Without passing the `--security-option` flag to docker, running gdb would
    # yield this:
    # warning: Error disabling address space randomization: Operation not permitted
    #
    # NOTE: At this time not sure if it wouldn't be possible to alter the
    # default seccomp security profile for Docker rather than fully turning it
    # off.  See https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/docs/security/seccomp.md
