Getting started with DTK
========================

Overview
--------

`DataTransferKit <https://github.com/ORNL-CEES/DataTransferKit>`_ is an
open-source software library of parallel solution transfer services for
multiphysics simulations. DTK uses a general operator design to provide
scalable algorithms for solution transfer between shared volumes and surfaces.

DTK was originally developed at the University of Wisconsin - Madison as part of
the Computational Nuclear Engineering Group (`CNERG <http://cnerg.github.io>`_)
and is now actively developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as part of
the Computational Engineering and Energy Sciences (`CEES
<http://energy.ornl.gov>`_) group.

DTK is supported and used by the following projects and programs:

* Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Laboratory Directed Research and
  Development (`LDRD
  <https://www.ornl.gov/content/laboratory-directed-research-development>`_)

* Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (`CASL
  <http://www.casl.gov>`_)

* Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (`NEAMS
  <http://www.ne.anl.gov/NEAMS/>`_)

* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (`NHTSA
  <http://batterysim.org>`_)
